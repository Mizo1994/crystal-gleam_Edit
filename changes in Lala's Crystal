============

Changes made on Nov.13:

Significantly buffed the level range of the wild pokemon and trainers on Shamouti Island (and related areas) to strenghten it's position as a true side-game/endgame area. If you tackle it as soon as you can, you'll expect to see trainers in the 55-60 range. If you wait as late as possible (16 badges), expect them to be around 85-90! Good luck!
